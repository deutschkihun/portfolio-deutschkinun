# Responsive web ui boilerplate

> Unlike mobile, desktops do not have a firm answer to size. The reason is that in the case of mobile, there is no problem because Galaxy or iPhone manufacturers provide sizes that meet the specifications and layout accordingly come out, but desktops are difficult to make based on specific products because their sizes vary too much. In order to develop the most optimized responsive web from a user interface perspective, it is important to first determine how many stages the grid should be.

The most optimized UI specifications presented in this project are as follows.



#### UI details 

    * Grid: 12 stages ( 1 x 12 or 2 x 6 or 3 x 4 or 4 x 3 or 6 x 2 or 12 x 1) 
    
    * Viewport: max-width -> 1920px or 100% (height: 1080px) 
    
    * Container (the largest width of content area): max-width: 1200px 
    
    * Offset: 360px  (1200px + offset of both side = 1920px) and center
   
    * Gutter: 30px (choose 30px,24px or 20px), space between 2 different columns
    
    * Columns: max-width: 72px 
        
    * media-query: tablet-device (480px - 768px), mobile (under 480px), desktop(over 768px)
